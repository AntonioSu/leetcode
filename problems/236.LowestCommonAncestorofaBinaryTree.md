**题目描述**  

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

 

**Note:**

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

解法一：简单的dfs

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!root || root==p || root==q) return root;
        //得到的是子节点
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        //返回父节点
        if (left && right) return root;
        
        return left ? left : right;       
    }
};
```

解法二：对上个算法的优化

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
       if (!root || p == root || q == root) return root;
       TreeNode *left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
       //表示已找到节点，不需要再找
       if (left && left != p && left != q) return left;
       TreeNode *right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p , q);
　　　　if (left && right) return root;
       return left ? left : right;
    }
};
```
