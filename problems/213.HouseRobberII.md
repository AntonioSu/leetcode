**题目描述**   

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

解法一：动态规划，和198.HouseRobber思路一样，这个只是环状，所以需要计算两次

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        return max(find_max(nums, 0, nums.size() - 2), find_max(nums, 1, nums.size() - 1));
    }
    int find_max(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end){
        if (nums.size() <= 0) return 0;
        if (nums.size() == 1) return start == 1 ? 0 : nums[0];
        if (nums.size() == 2) return nums[start];
        vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 0);
        dp[0] = nums[start];
        dp[1] = max(dp[0], nums[start + 1]);
        for (int i = 2; i + start <= end; ++i) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], nums[i + start] + dp[i - 2]);
        }
        return dp[nums.size() - 2];
    }
};
```
