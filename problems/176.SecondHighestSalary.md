**题目描述**   

 SQL Schema 

```mysql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('1', '100')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('2', '200')
insert into Employee (Id, Salary) values ('3', '300')
```

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return `null`.

```
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

**难度系数**    

Easy

解法一：先去除一个最大值，而后在剩下的部分寻找最大值

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
```

解法二：利用order by排序，且选择逆序

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT (
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC 
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```
