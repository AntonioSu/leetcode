#### **题目描述**
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted **ascending order**, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be `1` unit.

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, its next jump must be either `k - 1`, `k`, or `k + 1` units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between the 5th and 6th stone is too large.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= stones[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `stones[0] == 0`

解法一：令[*dp*[*i*] [*k*] 表示青蛙能否达到「现在所处的石子编号」为 i且「上一次跳跃距离」为 k 的状态。dp[*i*] [*k*]=dp[*j*] [*k*−1] || dp*[*j*][*k*] ||dp*[*j*] [*k*+1]

```python
class Solution:
    def canCross(self, stones: List[int]) -> bool:
        n=len(stones)
        dp=[[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
        dp[0][0]=True
        for i in range(1,n):
            for j in range(i-1,-1,-1):
                k=stones[i]-stones[j]
                #对于位置j，最远可跳j+1，如果k>j+1，则需要退出，否则，k有可能大于n，会越界
                if k>j+1:
                    break
                dp[i][k] = dp[j][k - 1] or  dp[j][k] or dp[j][k + 1]
                if i == n - 1 and dp[i][k]:
                    return True
        return False
```
