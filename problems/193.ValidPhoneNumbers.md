 **题目描述**   

Given a text file `file.txt` that contains list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

**Example:**

Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:

```
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
```

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:

```
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
```

**难度系数**    
Easy

解法一：使用grep的正则匹配
```bash
# Read from the file file.txt and output all valid phone numbers to stdout.
grep -E "^(\([0-9]{3}\) |[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$"      file.txt # ERE
```

解法二：使用awk的正则匹配, '/ /'之间的正则表示实际要匹配的

```bash
awk '/^(\([0-9]{3}\)\ |[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$/' file.txt
```
