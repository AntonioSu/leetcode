#### **题目描述**

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

解法一：把数组分成两段，记录分割后每一段的最大值，然后将两段相加，得到最终值

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        min_price, total_max_profit = float('inf'), 0
        # 记录顺序区间内每个坐标对应的利润最大值
        first_profit = [0]*len(prices)
        # 从左至右比遍历，获取顺序区间内一次交易利润的最大值
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            total_max_profit = max(total_max_profit, prices[i]-min_price)
            first_profit[i] = total_max_profit
        max_price, max_profit = float('-inf'), 0
        # 从右至左遍历，获取逆序区间内一次交易利润的最大值，两者相加得到两次利润的最大值
        for i in range(len(prices)-1, 0, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            max_profit = max(max_profit, max_price-prices[i])
            total_max_profit = max(total_max_profit, max_profit+first_profit[i-1])
        return total_max_profit

```
