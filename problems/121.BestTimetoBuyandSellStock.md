 **题目描述**   

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**难度系数**    
Easy

解法：只要比低于当前价格，那么就保存卖出最高价，否则就保存最低价
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int ans=0;
        if(prices.empty())
            return ans;
        int min_price=prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if(prices[i]>min_price)
                ans=ans>(prices[i]-min_price)?ans:(prices[i]-min_price);//计算当前利益
            else
                min_price=prices[i];//保存最低价
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
