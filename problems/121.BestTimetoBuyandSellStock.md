 **题目描述**   

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**难度系数**    
Easy

解法：此题要求只进行一次买卖操作，所以保存一个最低价，每次遍历到一个新的价格，新价格减去最低价，然后后最大利润作比较；
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int ans=0;
        if(prices.empty())
            return ans;
        int min_price=prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if(prices[i]>min_price)
                ans=ans>(prices[i]-min_price)?ans:(prices[i]-min_price);//计算当前利益
            else
                min_price=prices[i];//保存最低价
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
