 **题目描述**   

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**难度系数**    
Easy

解法：通过unordered_set函数来做，如果不为1，则数字一定会重复出现
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
    unordered_set<int> us;
    while (n!=1){
        if(us.find(n)!=us.end())
            return false;
        us.insert(n);
        int temp=n;
        n=0;
        while (temp){
            int num=temp%10;
            n+=num*num;
            temp=temp/10;
        }
    }
        return true;
    }
};
```
