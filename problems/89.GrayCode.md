#### **题目描述**
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer *n* representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].

思路：将二进制转化为格雷码，对应关系如下：![常用的二进制数与格雷码间的转换](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20160616130355566) 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> res;
        int m=pow(2,n);
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++){
            res.push_back(i^(i/2));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
