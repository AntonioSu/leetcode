**题目描述**   Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        long long low =1,high = x;
        long long mid,temp;
        while (low<=high){
            mid=(low+high)/2;
            temp=mid*mid;
            if(temp==x)return mid;
            else if (temp<x)low=mid+1;
            else high=mid-1;
        }
        return min(low,high);
    }
};
