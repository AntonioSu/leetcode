#### **题目描述**

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest substring of* `s` *such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to* `k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 105`

**难度系数**

解法一：当字符串某个字符的个数小于k的时候，那么按照这个字符分割， 而后再递归判断每一个子串是否满足

```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestSubstring(self, s, k):
        if len(s) < k:
            return 0
        for c in set(s):
            if s.count(c) < k:
                return max(self.longestSubstring(t, k) for t in s.split(c))
        return len(s)
```
