#### **题目描述**

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

**难度系数**    

Medium

解法一：需要两个变量，一个是向右移动的指针，一个是统计每个数字的重复个数，如果计数的个数小于等于2，则赋值

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:        

        index = count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 1
            if count <= 2:
                nums[index] = nums[i]
                index += 1
        return index
```

解法二：设置快慢指针，slow - 2表示已有两个值相等，所以只要是不相等的就可以赋值

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        slow = 0
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            if slow < 2 or nums[fast] != nums[slow - 2]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
        return slow
```
