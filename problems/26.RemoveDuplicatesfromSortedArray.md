**题目描述**   

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**难度系数**    

Easy

解法一：两个指针，一个记录没有重复的下标，另一个遍历数组。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int j=0,n=nums.size();
        if(n==0 || n==1) return n;
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i+1])
                nums[j++]=nums[i];
        nums[j++]=nums[n-1];
        return j;
    }
};
```

解法二：使用python实现，原理同解法一

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                j += 1
                nums[j] = nums[i]
        return j + 1
```
