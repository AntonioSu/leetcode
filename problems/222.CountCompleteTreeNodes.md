**题目描述**   

Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Note:**

**Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

**难度系数**    

Medium

解法：深度遍历即可

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==nullptr) return 0;
        return countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right)+1;
    }
};
```
