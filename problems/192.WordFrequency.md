**题目描述**

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

- `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
- Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
- Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

**Example:**

Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:

```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

```
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```

**Note:**

- Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
- Could you write it in one-line using [Unix pipes](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html)?

**难度系数**
Medium

解法：先将每个词变为一行，而后按字典序排序，排序之后统计每个字符出现的次数，最后按照词频逆序，最后打印

```bash
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
tr -s ' ' '\n' < words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | awk '{print $2, $1}'
```
