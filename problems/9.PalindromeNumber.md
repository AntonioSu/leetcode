#### **题目描述**
Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is palindrome integer.

An integer is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, `121` is palindrome while `123` is not.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: x = -101
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

解法：将数字转化为字符串

```python
class Solution(object):
     def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0:
            return False
        x = str(x)
        return True if x == x[::-1] else False
```
