#### **题目描述**

A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

 

**Note:**

- `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
- `S` will consist of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

**难度系数**

解法一：贪心算法，需要遍历字符串，得到每个字母最后一次出现的下标位置。从左到右遍历字符串，遍历的同时维护当前片段的开始下标 start 和结束下标end。当访问到下标end 时，当前片段访问结束，当前片段的下标范围是 [start,end]，将当前片段的长度添加到返回值，然后令start=end+1，继续寻找下一个片段。

```python

class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        last = [0] * 26
        for i, ch in enumerate(S):
            last[ord(ch) - ord("a")] = i
        
        partition = list()
        start = end = 0
        for i, ch in enumerate(S):
            end = max(end, last[ord(ch) - ord("a")])
            if i == end:
                partition.append(end - start + 1)
                start = end + 1
        
        return partition
