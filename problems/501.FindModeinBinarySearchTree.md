**题目描述**   

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 

For example:
Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
```

 

return `[2]`.

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

解法一：中序遍历，

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {
        inorder(root);
        return result;
    }
private:
    vector<int> result;
    int maxCount = 0, currentVal, tempCount = 0;
    void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return;
        inorder(root->left);
        tempCount++;
        if (root->val != currentVal) {
            currentVal = root->val;
            tempCount = 1;
        }
        if (tempCount > maxCount) {
            maxCount = tempCount;
            result.clear();
            result.push_back(root->val);
        } else if (tempCount == maxCount) {
            result.push_back(root->val);
        }
        inorder(root->right);
    }
};
```
