 **题目描述**   

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

解法：左右各一个指针，每次移动高度小的方向，同时保留最大值

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int start, end;
        int ret = 0;
        
        start = 0;
        end = height.size() - 1;
        
        while (start < end)
        {
            ret = max(ret, min(height[start], height[end])*(end - start));
            
            if (height[start] < height[end])
            {
                start++;
            }
            else
                end--;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
};
```
