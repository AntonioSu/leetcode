**题目描述**   

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 3999`

解法：从最大数值考虑，逐步减小

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string intToRoman(int num) {
        string r = "";
        while(num){
           if(num >= 1000){
               num -= 1000;
               r +="M";
           }else if(num >= 900){
               num -= 900;
               r += "CM";
           }else if(num >= 500){
               num -= 500;
               r +="D";
           }else if(num >= 400){
               num -= 400;
               r += "CD";
           }else if(num >= 100){
               num -= 100;
               r +="C";
           }else if(num >= 90){
               num -= 90;
               r += "XC";
           }else if(num >= 50){
               num -= 50;
               r +="L";
           }else if(num >= 40){
               num -= 40;
               r += "XL";
           }else if(num >= 10){
               num -= 10;
               r +="X";
           }else if(num >= 9){
               num -= 9;
               r += "IX";
           }else if(num >= 5){
               num -= 5;
               r +="V";
           }else if(num >= 4){
               num -= 4;
               r += "IV";
           }else if(num >= 1){
               num -= 1;
               r +="I";
           }
        }
        return r;
    }
};
