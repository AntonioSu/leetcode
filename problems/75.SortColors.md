**题目描述**   

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

解法：通过三个指针，分别记录0/1/2的位置

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size() ;
        int begin = 0, i = 0, end =n-1;
        while (i<=end){
            int temp;
            if (nums[i] == 0){//遇到0就交换到begin对应的位置
                swap(nums[i],nums[begin]);
                begin++;
                i++;
            }
            else if (nums[i] == 1) i++;//遇到1就向前移动
            else if (nums[i] == 2){//遇到2就交换到end指针对应的位置
                swap(nums[i],nums[end]);
                end--;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
