### 题目描述
Given an array of integers that is already ***sorted in ascending order\***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

**难度系数**    
Easy

思路：因为给定数组有序，设置左右指针，来找到目标值

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(numbers)==0:
            return None
        l=0
        r=len(numbers)-1
        list=[]
        while l<r:
            if numbers[l]+numbers[r]==target:
                list.append(l+1)
                list.append(r+1)
                return list
            elif numbers[l]+numbers[r]<target:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1

        return None
```
