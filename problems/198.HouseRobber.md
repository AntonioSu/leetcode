**题目描述**

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

**难度系数**
Easy

解法：动态规划

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
		int Pre1 = 0;
		int Pre2 = 0;
		int Cur = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            //考虑偷本屋子和不投本屋子两种情况
			Cur = max(Pre1, Pre2 + nums[i]);
			Pre2 = Pre1;
			Pre1 = Cur;
		}
		return  Cur;
	}
};
