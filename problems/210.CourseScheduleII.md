#### **题目描述**
There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
```

**Note:**

1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

解法一：BFS，通过二维矩阵来表示图，同时记录入度

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findOrder(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        //拓扑排序的图
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses, vector<int>());
        vector<int> in(numCourses);//记录每个节点的入度
        queue<int> que;//将入度为0的节点入栈
        vector<int> ans;
        for (auto item : prerequisites) {
            //对于[1,0],变为0->1,记录1的入度为1
            graph[item[1]].push_back(item[0]);
            ++in[item[0]];
        }
        //将入度为0的点，push到队列
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (in[i] == 0) que.push(i);
        }
        while (!que.empty()) {
            int t = que.front(); que.pop();
            ans.push_back(t);
            //遍历t节点的后续节点，对于后续节点，如果入度为0，则入队
            for (auto item : graph[t]) {
                --in[item];
                if (in[item] == 0) que.push(item);
            }
        }
        //如果所有的入度均为0，则是无环图
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (in[i] != 0) return {};
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
