 **题目描述**   

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

 **难度系数**    
Easy

解法：左右各一个指针，向中心移动
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int left=0,right=s.size()-1;
        while (left<right){
            swap(s[left],s[right]);
            left++;right--;
        }

    }
};
```
