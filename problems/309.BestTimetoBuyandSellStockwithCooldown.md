 **题目描述**   

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)

 **难度系数**    

 Medium 

**Example**

```
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

解法：买入、卖出、休息一天各一个状态，

```c++
class Solution {
    //参照连接https://www.cnblogs.com/jdneo/p/5228004.html
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices){
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        vector<int> s0(prices.size(), 0);
        vector<int> s1(prices.size(), 0);
        vector<int> s2(prices.size(), 0);
        s1[0] = -prices[0];//表示买入
        s0[0] = 0;//表示休息一天
        s2[0] = INT_MIN;//表示卖出
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            s0[i] = max(s0[i - 1], s2[i - 1]);
            s1[i] = max(s1[i - 1], s0[i - 1] - prices[i]);
            s2[i] = s1[i - 1] + prices[i];
        }
        //返回卖出或者是休息一天的最大值
        return max(s0[prices.size() - 1], s2[prices.size() - 1]);
    }
};
```
