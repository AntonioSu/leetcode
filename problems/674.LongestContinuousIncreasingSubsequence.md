#### **题目描述**

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
```



**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

解法一：重点是数组越界问题，不需要考虑正负号，-123%10=-3

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        int ans = 1, currMax = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i+1]) ans = max(ans, ++currMax);
            else currMax = 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
