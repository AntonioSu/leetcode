**题目描述**   

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

**Examples 1**
Input:

```
  5
 /  \
2   -3
```

return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.



**Examples 2**
Input:

```
  5
 /  \
2   -5
```

return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.



**Note:** You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

解法：记录每棵树的和，并记录出现的次数，最后返回将出现次数最多的

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int,int>um;
    vector<int> findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> ans; 
        int frequent=0;
        dfs(root,frequent);
        for (auto item:um) {
            if(item.second==frequent) ans.push_back(item.first);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int  dfs(TreeNode* root,int &frequent){
        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        int left=dfs(root->left,frequent);
        int right=dfs(root->right,frequent);
        int sum=left+right+root->val;
        um[sum]++;
        frequent=max(frequent,um[sum]);
        return sum;
    }
};
```
