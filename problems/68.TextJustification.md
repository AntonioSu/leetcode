**题目描述**   

Given an array of words and a width *maxWidth*, format the text such that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no **extra** space is inserted between words.

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
- Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed *maxWidth*.
- The input array `words` contains at least one word.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
         "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]
```

 **难度系数**    

Hard

解释： 主要难点在于空格的安排，首先每个单词之间必须有空格隔开，而当当前行放不下更多的单词时，我们要把空格均匀的填充在单词之间。如果剩余的空格量刚好是间隔倍数那么就均匀分配即可，否则还必须把多的空格逐个的放到左边的词之间。 

解法：考虑三种情况：最后一行，非最后一行只有一个词，非最后一行有多个词

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        int len = words.size();
        vector<string> result;
        //记录一行词在words中的的起始和结束位置
        int beginindex = 0, endindex = 0;
        while(true){
            int sumsize = 0;//记录各个词总和的长度
            string tmp(maxWidth, ' ');
            while(endindex < len){
                if(sumsize + words[endindex].size() + endindex - beginindex > maxWidth)
                    break;
                sumsize += words[endindex].size();
                ++endindex;
            }
            
            int index = 0;
            //到达了末尾
            if(endindex == len){
                for(int i = beginindex;i < endindex; ++i){
                    for(int j = 0;j < words[i].size(); ++j)
                        tmp[index++] = words[i][j];
                    if(index < maxWidth)//确保不大于最长长度，有可能结尾处是字符，非空格
                        tmp[index++] = ' ';
                }
            }else{
                //只包含部分，必须区分间隔
                int wordcnt = endindex - beginindex;
                if(wordcnt == 1){//只有一个单词
                    for(int i = 0;i < sumsize; ++i)
                        tmp[index++] = words[beginindex][i];
                }else{//包含多个单词
                    int averagespace = (maxWidth - sumsize) / (wordcnt - 1);//平均空格
                    int remainspace = (maxWidth - sumsize) - averagespace * (wordcnt - 1);//剩余空格，逐个的将空格从左向右添加到字符串中
                    for(int i = beginindex;i < endindex; ++i){
                        for(int j = 0;j < words[i].size(); ++j)
                            tmp[index++] = words[i][j];
                        index = index + averagespace;
                        if(remainspace > 0){
                            --remainspace;
                            index++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            beginindex = endindex;
            result.push_back(tmp);
            if(endindex == len) break;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
