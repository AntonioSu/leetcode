#### **题目描述**
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

解法一：动态规划

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        // edge case
        if (obstacleGrid.size() == 0 || obstacleGrid.front().size() == 0) return 0;
        //总体思想就是（i,j）位置的路径数等于（i-1,j）+（i,j-1）
        for (int i = 0; i < obstacleGrid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < obstacleGrid.front().size(); j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) { // obstacle
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0;
                } else {
                    if (i > 0 && j > 0) { // neither first row nor column
                        obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] + obstacleGrid[i][j - 1];
                    } else if (i > 0) { // first column
                        obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i - 1][j];
                    } else if (j > 0){ // first row
                        obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i][j - 1];
                    } else { // first square
                        obstacleGrid[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return obstacleGrid[obstacleGrid.size() - 1][obstacleGrid.front().size() - 1]; // last square
    }
};
```
