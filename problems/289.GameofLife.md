**题目描述**

According to the [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a *board* with *m* by *n* cells, each cell has an initial state *live* (1) or *dead* (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

**Follow up**:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

解法一：新建一个辅助数组，最后交换数组。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numOfLiveCells(const vector<vector<int>>& board, int m, int n,
        int i, int j)
    {
        const int MAX_NB = 8;
        
        const int di[MAX_NB] = {0,-1,-1,-1,0,1,1,1};
        const int dj[MAX_NB] = {-1,-1,0,1,1,1,0,-1};
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < MAX_NB; ++k) {
            int ni = i + di[k];
            int nj = j + dj[k];
            
            if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n &&
                board[ni][nj] == 1) {
                ++ret;   
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int m = board.size();
        if (m == 0) {
            return;
        }
        
        int n = board[0].size();
        if (n == 0) {
            return;
        }
         
        vector<vector<int>> aux = board;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                auto live = numOfLiveCells(board, m, n, i, j);
                if (board[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (live < 2) {
                        aux[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                    else if (live > 3) {
                        aux[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
                else {
                    if (live == 3) {
                        aux[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        board.swap(aux);
    }
};
```

解法二：ENCODING将活着的状态分别表示为11 12，包括还未处理活着的状态1；死的状态表示为 10，包括还未处理的0；DECODING分别按照三种状态处理board

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNeighbours (vector<vector<int>>& board, int row, int col) {
        vector<int> rows = {-1,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,1};
        vector<int> cols = {-1,0,1,-1,1,-1,0,1};
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<rows.size();i++) {
            int newRow = row + rows[i];
            int newCol = col + cols[i];
            //board[newRow][newCol]%10，因为活着的信息包含有 1 12 11 三种情况，死的信息包含0、10
            if(newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && board[newRow][newCol]%10 != 0)
                res++;
        }
        return res;
    }

    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int prevLiveNowDie = 12;
        int prevLiveNowLive = 11;
        int prevDieNowLive = 10;
        int m = board.size(), n = board[0].size();
        //ENCODING
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
                int cnt = countNeighbours(board, i, j);
                if(board[i][j] && cnt < 2) {
                    board[i][j] = prevLiveNowDie;
                }
                else if(board[i][j] && cnt >= 2 && cnt <= 3) {
                    board[i][j] = prevLiveNowLive;
                }
                else if(board[i][j]) {
                    board[i][j] = prevLiveNowDie;
                }
                else if(cnt == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = prevDieNowLive;
                }
            }
        }
        //DECODING
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++) {
            for(int j=0;j<n;j++) {
                if(board[i][j] == prevLiveNowDie) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                }
                else if(board[i][j] == prevLiveNowLive || board[i][j] == prevDieNowLive) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
