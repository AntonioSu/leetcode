**题目描述**   

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

**难度系数**    

Hard

解法：dp[i]表示从0到i之间的字符串最少的切割数，所以对j属于0~i之间的每一个值就行遍历，dp[i]就等于dp[j-1]+1，如果j~i之间是回文串

```java
class Solution {
  public int minCut(String s) {
    int len = s.length();
    int[] dp = new int[len];

    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
      dp[i] = i;
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
        boolean flag=true;
        int right = i , left = j;
        while (left <= right) {
          if (s.charAt(left)!=s.charAt(right)){
            flag=false;
            break;
          }
          left++;right--;
        }
        if(flag&&j==0)dp[i]=0;//这种代表不用切割，整个字符串就是回文
        else if(flag) dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + 1);
      }
    }
    return dp[len - 1];
  }
}
```
